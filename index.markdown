         		 <br>
                 <p>Participation in the Eagle's Nest HOA is not voluntary, it is mandatory. By purchasing real estate in Eagle's Nest, you are agreeing to and bound by the information contained in the Eagle’s Nest Public Use Statement. Dues are assessed at annually, per lot. This money is used for a variety of HOA related expenses, such as road maintenance, common area improvements, security, etc. The HOA sends written notice annually, to each owner, to collect those dues. Failure to pay annual dues can result in late payment penalties and, in extreme cases, a lien may be attached to the property.</p>
